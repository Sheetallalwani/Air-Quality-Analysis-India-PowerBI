# Air Quality Analysis of India - Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing the air quality across major Indian cities using data obtained from **Kaggle**.  
The goal was to visualize air quality trends, pollutant levels, and identify the most and least polluted regions in India.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Source: Kaggle dataset (Air Quality Data – India)  
- Removed empty and duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy  
- Cleaned missing values using Power Query  
- Added calculated columns and DAX measures for better analysis  
- Created a **“Last Refresh Date”** card using the `MAX()` function to display the most recent data update

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified top and least polluted cities based on **Air Quality Index (AQI)**  
- Compared pollutant levels such as **PM2.5, SO2, Xylene, and Toluene**  
- Visualized AQI trends over time using line and bar charts  
- Used a **map visualization** to show area-wise AQI distribution

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboard Design)  
- Power Query (Data Cleaning)  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Kaggle (Data Source)

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- DAX calculations and KPI creation  
- Interactive dashboard building  
- Data storytelling and visualization design
